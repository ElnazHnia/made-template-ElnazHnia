## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Awesome MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does public concern about climate change correlate with national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets across different countries?

## Description

The aim of the files address a critical aspect of environmental policy and public engagement by examining whether a stronger public concern about climate change influences or is reflected in the ambitiousness of national policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It seeks to identify if there is a positive correlation where countries with higher levels of public concern also have more stringent emission reduction targets, or if discrepancies exist, indicating areas where public awareness could potentially be improved to support more aggressive climate action.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Climate change mitigation policies and measures (greenhouse gas emissions)
* Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/data_climate-change-mitigation-policies-and-measures-1?locale=en
* Data URL: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/climate-change-mitigation-policies-and-measures-1/pam-table/climate-change-mitigation-policies-and-3/download.csv
* Data Type: CSV
This file likely contains data on national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including specific goals set by countries as part of their commitments to international climate agreements like the Paris Accord. Analyzing this file can provide insights into the governmental response to climate change challenges.
### Datasource2: International Climate Change Opinion Survey
* Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/https-opendata-edf-fr-explore-dataset-enquete-dopinion-internationale-sur-le-changement-climatique-obscop-?locale=en
* Data URL: https://opendata.edf.fr/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/enquete-dopinion-internationale-sur-le-changement-climatique-obscop/exports/csv
* Data Type: CSV
This file is presumed to contain survey data reflecting public opinions and concerns regarding climate change across various countries. The data might include perceptions about the seriousness of climate issues, urgency for action, and personal impact assessments.
