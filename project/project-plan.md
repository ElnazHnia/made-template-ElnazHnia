# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Awesome MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How have changes in forest cover impacted climate indicators like temperature in different countries from 2000 to 2022?

## Description

The aim of the "Climate Change Indicators" dataset is to track and analyze temperature variations across different countries over time, providing insights into global and regional climate change trends. The "Forest Shares" dataset, on the other hand, is designed to monitor changes in forest cover percentages over two decades, identifying trends in deforestation or reforestation. Both datasets are instrumental for environmental studies, helping to evaluate the impact of natural and human activities on climate and ecosystems, and to inform relevant conservation and sustainability policies.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Climate Change Indicators
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarunrm09/climate-change-indicators
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarunrm09/climate-change-indicators?elect=climate_change_indicators.csv
* Data Type: CSV
This dataset has climate change indicators for different countries with their associated codes(ISO2 AND ISO3). The measurement has been updated yearly till 2022 from 1961.
### Datasource2: Deforestation
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/deforestation-dataset
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/deforestation-dataset?select=goal15.forest_shares.csv
* Data Type: CSV
It aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
